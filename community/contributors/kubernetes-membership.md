Sponsors 会在下面回复, 例如:

```
I was surprised @carlory is not the organization member yet :-)
+1 for his membership.
```

```
/lgtm
+1 Thanks for contributions!
```

当两个及以上的Sponsors表示同意后, 社区会在该Issue下评论如下信息:

```
@carlory I've created PR #2412 to add you to the Kubernetes Org. Once that gets merged, you should get a membership invite notification.

Welcome to @kubernetes! 🎉
